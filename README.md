Product API -> https://xxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod/product
Basket API -> https://xxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod/basket
Ordering API -> https://xxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/prod/order
Useful commands
npm run build compile typescript to js
npm run watch watch for changes and compile
npm run test perform the jest unit tests
cdk deploy deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
